## 🗒️ Notes

**A Note on Readings**

All readings may be found linked from the course content pages.  Readings will be posted at least one week ahead of time. Each day will have one or two primary sources that should be read, listened to, or watched in full, a series of simpler secondary readings (often, news coverage, podcasts, and/or videos) that should be browsed or scanned, and (frequently) further secondary and background reference reading for those interested in diving deeper. 

**Undergraduate students** are expected to read or listen to the primary source(s) for the day and scan background readings. 

**Graduate students** are expected to read or listen to the primary source(s), scan secondary readings, and select one or more of the secondary or background readings to read in further depth, as well.
