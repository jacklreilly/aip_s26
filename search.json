It presumes no particular prior knowledge of artificial intelligence, political science, public policy, or computer science; rather, it will introduce students to what artificial intelligence is as well as to the ethics of AI, its social implications, and the policy choices around AI that currently face governments, corporations, and organizations worldwide. This is a “non-technical” course: assignments will include reading, class discussion and leadership, debates, writing, and learning about the use of AI tools and prompts to generate output. Students will not be expected, however, to program or write any formal code.\n\n\n\nPrinciple - Practice - Politics - Policy\nThe course moves from the conceptual to the practical. First, we start with an introduction to the philosophy of artificial intelligence itself. What is “intelligence” and “consciousness” in the first place? What are minds? What are agents and legal persons, and when are agents responsible for their actions? What is artificial intelligence, and what is artificial “general” intelligence? Second, we proceed to discuss the mechanics of current computational approaches to AI, with a particular focus on large language models (such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT), including approachable, non-technical overviews of the principles behind machine learning, neural networks, and assorted technologies that have given rise to the current state of the art in AI. Third, we consider the societal impacts of current artificial intelligence systems, including data practices as well as current AI applications, uses, risks, and ethics. Fourth, we turn to policy, examining the decisions in front of governments, companies, and organizations in the United States and worldwide as well as complications in the policy process for producing effective AI legislation.\n\n\n\nIntroductory coursework in (any) related area(s). No particular knowledge is expected, but the reading level is high and this course may not be suitable for first year students.\nWhile this course has no formal pre-requisites, it does have a substantial informal prerequisite: motivation.

Mind Design III: Philosophy, Psychology, and Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n\n\nComputing\nWe will make use of AI models in class as end-users, so you should have a computer you can use to access them. No coding will be required in the course.\nSyracuse University has a campus-wide license to the enterprise version of Anthropic’s Claude, which gives you increased usage before your compute is limited. Anthropic also guarantees Syracuse that it will not train Claude’s models on your data. I recommend you use it when asked in course assignments if you do not have higher-level access to another LLM. Syracuse University: Claude Enterprise\n\n\nOnline Course Resources\n\nWebsite\nThis course website is our primary source of course organization and material: here, you can find the course syllabus, daily content, assignments, and more.\n\n\nBlackboard\nBlackboard is our internet-based course platform: http://blackboard.syr.edu. In it, you will find submission portals for assignments and a link to our course webpage, along with (potentially) a few resources that are copyright protected and not suitable to post here.\n\n\nMicrosoft Teams\nIn addition to Blackboard, we’ll have a class discussion channel in Microsoft Teams for discussion question sharing as well as for sharing news articles. Make sure you set up easy access for yourself wherever is convenient."

    "text": "📌 Course Requirements\n\nOverview\n\nSeminar Participation (20%)\n\nAttendance, Reading, and Participation\nDiscussion Questions\nAI News Submissions\nDiscussion Leadership\n\nPrepared Work for Class (40%)\n\nDebates (30%)\nShort Assignments (10%)\n\nCore Exam (20%)\nFinal Project (20%)\n\nPresentation\nPaper\n\n\n\n\nSeminar Participation\n\nDaily Attendance, Participation, and Reading\nThis is a preceptorial-style seminar taught at a high level: it only works if everyone takes part. I have a high opinion of your intellectual capability and a similarly high opinion of the quality of your potential contributions - make sure to show them to me!\n\n\nDiscussion Questions\nSubmit discussion questions or points (broadly construed) to the class by 9 AM on the day of class. Make sure to send messages to the course Teams chat so everyone can read them.\n\n\nAI News Submissions\nIn class, we’ll occasionally use time in class to discuss AI news from the week. (Especially if something particularly interesting happens . . . which, because this is AI, happens a lot). If you come across interesting AI news - or broad tech industry news - submit it to our Teams chat.\n\n\nDiscussion Leadership\nEach class has an assigned discussion leader from among the students. While all students are under an obligation to read (or listen, or watch) the material each day from class, the discussion leader has a special role as the person who starts our discussion for the day rolling, and steps in should our discussion of the day’s material falter.\n\n\nParticipation Grading Policy\nA seminar like this doesn’t work if everyone only seeks to do the bare minimum. Informed class participation is expected and required each day in class; you shouldn’t be counting things like “I submitted a number of news articles already this semester, so I no longer need to submit news articles or talk in class”. Participate across all elements of the seminar as and when the spirit moves you, and keep that participation up through the semester, and you’ll do fine for this portion of the class.2\nWith that said, it is useful to have some baselines and expectations for everyone to keep in mind. A few that are useful:\n\nAttendance: One of the guiding principles of my class is that you are adults, and thus, capable of managing your own obligations and time. I have little interest in policing your lives, and I understand that everyone has bad days, things that come up, etc.3 You can miss up to three days of class without excuse or penalty, unless that day is a day you have a special obligation. If you are supposed to be a discussion leader, or giving a presentation, taking part in a debate, or miss more than three days, make sure to send me a note.\n\nDiscussion Questions: At least one each day. (Although do note: you should sometimes submit more than one, too!)\nIn-Class Participation: We should hear your contributions every day. We’ll have systems in class to make sure that everyone gets a turn. I won’t be keeping exact tallies of who said what, or how much, but I will take note of your general contribution tendencies.\n\nNews Submissions: At least two news submissions per semester (hopefully more)!\nDiscussion Leadership: Split evenly according to the number of students in the class.\n\n\n\n\nPrepared Class Work\n\nDebates\nWe will have six formal debates in the class, following a modified Lincoln-Douglas debate format (if you are unfamiliar with these rules, don’t worry! We’ll cover them.) Each student will have a role in each debate, although not all roles are equal: it is easier to judge than it is to affirm or negate. All students will have equal debate responsibilities across the class.\n\n\nShort Assignments\nSmall assignments about AI tools will be given throughout the semester. They may involve presentations to the class.\n\n\n\nCore Exam\nAn in class test on AI basics, held in the middle of the semester.\n\n\nFinal Project\nA final research project on an aspect of AI policy. (There will be options.) Graduate students will have higher expectations than undergraduates."

    "text": "🎓 Course Expectations & Guidelines\n\nEtiquette & Decorum\nThis is an upper level undergraduate and graduate course: I take it for granted that you have a basic interest in the material and an enthusiastic attitude toward participation. A university classroom is fundamentally a learning community that operates on respect: be courteous to fellow students and the professor, attend class on time, listen to fellow seminar participants when they talk, and disagree (or agree) with others’ arguments professionally. Keep cell phones and other technology silenced and out of sight unless doing something directly relevant to the discussion in the class.4\n\n\nOffice & Consultation Hours, Appointments\nI encourage you to chat with me at any point if you have questions about the course. You are always welcome to drop by my office hours, and can schedule a meeting with me by going to my website here: http://jacklreilly.github.io. You do not need an appointment for regularly scheduled drop-in office hours: they are there for you! Furthermore, I have a general open-door policy: feel free to stop by to see if my door is open, and if it is, just come on in. (Don’t feel like you’re intruding! I’ll tell you if it’s not a good time.)\n\n\nE-mail\nEmail is the best way to contact me. I try to be pretty responsive, but as a baseline, I always aim to get back to you in a modified 24-hour fashion: by the end of the business day the day after you email (at minimum). So if you email me at 2 PM Tuesday, I’ll get back to you by 6 PM Wednesday at the latest; if 10 PM Thursday, by 6 PM Friday; if you email me at 3 PM on Friday, by 6 PM Monday, etc.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your email requires a long response, expect me to encourage you to meet with me in person so we can have a more effective discussion.\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Class Technology Policy\nTo be discussed (and decided upon!) in class on a per-assignment basis."

That’s OK! The attendance policy is designed so that you typically don’t have to tell me you missed because you have a medical emergency or a family matter you’d rather not discuss.↩︎\nRemember that technology presents a significant negative externality: it is not just you that is distracted, but it is you who are distracting others as well with the bright shiny colors on your screen.↩︎\nUsually I aim to be much much faster!

    "text": "The following reflects the approved campus-wide academic policies of Syracuse University. For more information and detail, please consult the full documentation of University policies here.\n\n\nAs part of our efforts to track satisfactory academic progress, the Academic Drop Deadline and the Financial Drop Deadline will both occur on September 15, 2025, for the fall semester and February 2, 2026, for the spring semester. Students may still withdraw from courses after these deadlines; this would place a ‘WD’ grade on their transcripts. Students enrolled in “flex” classes (Flexibly formatted classes) have different deadlines and will need to check MySlice for the Academic and Financial Drop deadlines that pertain to their class.\n\n\n\nAs a pre-eminent and inclusive student-focused research institution, Syracuse University considers academic integrity at the forefront of learning, serving as a core value and guiding pillar of education. Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy provides students with the necessary guidelines to complete academic work with integrity throughout their studies. Students are required to uphold both course-specific and university-wide academic integrity expectations such as crediting your sources, doing your own work, communicating honestly, and supporting academic integrity. The full Syracuse University Academic Integrity Policy can be viewed by visiting the Syracuse University Policies website.\nUpholding Academic Integrity includes the protection of faculty’s intellectual property. Students should not upload, distribute, or share instructors’ course materials, including presentations, assignments, exams, or other evaluative materials without permission. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others, which are then presented as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation. All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person assignments, quizzes, and exams also apply online.\nStudents found in violation of the policy are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. Students may not drop or withdraw from courses in which they face a suspected violation. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\n\n\n\nBased on the specific learning outcomes and assignments in this course, artificial intelligence is permitted on the following: selected course assignments. Artificial intelligence is not permitted on in-class exams. See each assignment, quiz, or exam instructions for more information about what artificial intelligence tools are permitted and to what extent, as well as citation requirements. If no instructions are provided for a specific assignment, then no use of any artificial intelligence tool is permitted. Any AI use beyond that which is detailed in course assignments is explicitly prohibited except when documented permission is granted.\nPlease also see Syracuse University’s general campus AI policies here.\nI, as the instructor, may use generative AI tools to help develop course materials. When I do, I take full responsibility for reviewing and verifying all AI-generated content to ensure it is accurate, appropriate and aligned with our learning objectives. All final course materials represent my professional judgment about what will best support your learning.\n\n\n\nAll academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.\nUsing websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation, resulting in suspension or expulsion from Syracuse University.\n\n\n\nAttendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. It is a federal requirement that faculty promptly notify the university of students who do not attend or cease to attend any class. Faculty will use Early-Semester Progress Reports and Mid-Semester Progress Reports in Orange SUccess to alert the Registrar and Financial Aid Office on non-attendance. For more information visit:\nFaculty: Information for Faculty: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending Students: Information for Students: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending\nIf a student is unable to participate in-person or virtually for an extended period of time (48 hours or more), the student may request an absence notification from their home school/college Dean’s Office or through Student Outreach and Support office. Instructors will be notified via the “Absence Notification” flag in Orange SUccess.\nBarnes Center at the Arch (Health, Counseling, etc.) staff will not provide medical excuse notes for students. When Barnes Center staff determine it is medically necessary to remove a student from classes, they will coordinate with Student Outreach and Support case management staff to provide appropriate notification to faculty through Orange Success. For absences lasting less than 48 hours, students are encouraged to discuss academic arrangements directly with their faculty.\nAdditional information may be found at Student Outreach and Support: Absence Notifications.\n\n\n\nThis class will use the Blackboard Learning Management to house the syllabus, course content, links to external course materials, assignments, quizzes, exams, feedback, and grades. Due dates and times in Blackboard are stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and displayed for each user based on the time zone setting of their computer and data from their internet browser. The system will always display the time zone being used. If an instructor sets a due date of 11pm Eastern time, a student in the Pacific time zone will see a due date of 8pm.”\nInformation about Blackboard is available on Answers Blackboard; alternatively, you can contact Information Technology Services by sending an email to help@syr.edu, calling 315.443.2677, or in-person at the ITS Service Center, located at 1-227 CST in the Life Sciences Complex. Business hours for the Service Center can be found on the ITS website.\n\n\n\nThe University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, reproductive health decisions, disability, marital status, political or social affiliation, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender.\nAny complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer for Faculty and Staff. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under the various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 621 Skytop Road, Suite 1001, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244-1120; or by email: equalopp@syr.edu; or by telephone: 315-443-4018.\n\n\n\nIt is the intent of this course for students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives to be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is also critical to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let your instructor know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.\n\n\n\nSyracuse University values access and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be necessary to ensure equitable access, and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process.\nIf you would like to discuss disability-related accommodations or register with CDR, please visit Center for Disability Resources. Please call 315.443.4498 or email CDRspecialist@syr.edu for more detailed information.\nCDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations are generally not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible to initiate this process.\n\n\n\nSyracuse University’s Religious Observances Policy recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holy days according to their traditions. Under the policy, students are given an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance, provided they notify their instructors no later than the academic drop deadline. For observances occurring before the drop deadline, notification is required at least two academic days in advance. Students may enter their observances in MySlice under Student Services/Enrollment/My Religious Observances/Add a Notification.\n\n\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) sets forth requirements regarding the privacy of student records. FERPA governs both the access to and release of those records, known as education records, and the information they contain. Under FERPA, faculty have a legal responsibility to protect the confidentiality of student records. For additional information about FERPA and Syracuse University’s FERPA policy, see Compliance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act or contact the Office of the Registrar (315.443.2422).\n\n\n\nWell-being and mental health are significant predictors of academic success. It is critical to take care of yourself physically and emotionally and to effectively navigate stress, anxiety, and depression. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the Barnes Center provides https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/ and seek out support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are available 24/7, 365 days, at 315-443-8000.\n\n\n\nORANGE ALERT, Syracuse University’s crisis notification system, uses text messages, phone, and email alerts to provide rapid notification and instructions to members of the University community in the event of a crisis in progress. In the event of an emergency, please use one of the following numbers to reach us:\nFrom any phone: 315.443.2224 From your cell phone: #78 (#SU) Campus landline: 711\nFor more information on ORANGE ALERT, including how to update your contact information, visit the DPS website."

Understudies are prepared to play that role in the event of an unexpected absence by the lead.\nIt is up to individual teams to equitably fill out debate roles. Each role can play to the strengths of different individuals. The constructive, for instance, is a three minute delivered speech, and possibly the single most important part of the debate - but is also the only portion that can be fully prepared in advance. It is good for a person who is a dynamic speaker but who may not be as strong thinking on their feet. All other components are a mix of pre-prepared material as well as adjustments that happen in real time.\nFinally, while student take roles, it is the entire team’s responsibility to coordinate and prepare for each debate; it should not be the case that the person delivering the constructive is the only person to take part in writing it.3",

If challenged, if you cannot support the fact with a specific citation on your reference sheet, the jury is instructed to disregard the claim.\nNormal class rules on etiquette apply: I encourage you to have fun with the debate and get into it, but remember that you are debating a resolution, not people. Do not make it personal or attack the other team in ad hominem fashion. Professional disagreement is expected, disrespect is not.\nAppeals or complaints on process, fairness, etc, are made to the judge. The judge, however, is primarily a glorified timekeeper: most appeals are unsuccessful so long as teams stay within time limits and maintain appropriate decorum. It is up to the teams themselves to resolve substantive disputes about content.\nBoth teams must agree, a week and a half before the debate, on the policy for AI usage for debate preparation. Once made, this decision is binding on both teams and cannot be changed.\nIf time runs out mid-sentence, speakers must stop immediately. I recommend keeping time yourself.",

    "text": "General Tips and Advice\n\nRefer to the other team as “our opponents” or “my opponent”.\nThink carefully about the resolution. What exactly is the resolution asking you to debate? Do not allow yourself to be distracted by anything off topic (which good debaters will try to do, of course).\n\nThe only thing you need to do to beat an genuinely off topic argument is say “Judge, please disregard my opponent’s contention because it is off topic.” (Of course, if the jury does not think that a contention is off topic, this may backfire.)\n\nDefine the terms of the debate. Resolutions, by their nature, have inherent ambiguities. Define and frame the resolution further in a way that is simultaneously fair and that gives you an argumentative advantage. Make the terms of the debate clear to the judges: what, for instance, should determine a winner and loser in the debate? What points does your side need to make and what points does the other side need to make to win?\nIn oral debate presentation, clarity is key. Subtlety is not your friend. Use the following format for your constructive speech:\n\nClaim I (The first point you argue. Literally say, “Our first claim is that . . . “)\n\nWarrant (“This is true because…”)\nEvidence\nImpact (“This is important because…”)\n\nClaim II (The second point you argue)\n\nWarrant\nEvidence\nImpact\n\nClaim III (The third point you argue)\n\nWarrant\nEvidence\nImpact\n\n\nIn cross examination, avoid the trap of over explaining or over questioning. The most memorable points are quick and pithy. If you’re asking too long a question, both the other team and the jury will lose track of what you’re asking. (You have all other parts of the debate to speech-ify. This is your time to exract concessions from your opponents directly.)\nIn questions, go on the offensive and ask questions that you know your opponents don’t have good answers for. Good examples of questions include:\n\nTesting assumptions: “Does your argument depend on . . .”\nHighlight tradeoffs: “Does your policy require sacrificing . . .”\nClarifications: “What exactly do you mean by . . .”\nLock in concessions: “Do you agree that . . .”\n\nIf you’re over explaining in response, you’re probably losing. More time spent in response is more time spent in your opponents debate frame, and less time in yours. Answer honestly, but remember that too much time in reponse is time that you’re not spending pressing your opponent on the weaknesses in their arguments.\nRemember: The cross examination is more typically won by asking good questions rather than having good responses. Prepare accordingly.\nThe rebuttal and final focus have different purposes. The rebuttal is where you tell the judge and jury why your opponents are wrong and you are right. The final focus is where you focus the judge on jury on why you should win the debate.\nUse the similar format for your rebuttal and final focus:\n\nMy opponent’s arguments are incorrect becuase/here is why we’ve won today’s round:\n\nReason (Tell the jury very literally why they should vote for you)\nReason\nReason\n\n\nPay attention to your time. The debate can feel simultaneously short and long - a three minute constructive is plenty of time to say what you need to, so long as you plan well ahead of time. Use all of your time effectively but do not go over.\nSpeak quickly if you can, but above all else be clear and calm. If you want to perform well you must practice giving your constructive speech at least twice.\nUse resources from class, including readings and lectures, as well as material from outside class. Consider the optional readings listed in the course agenda. They are there to help you.\nRemember: if you want to win, you need to focus on persuading your judges. How many times have you been in an argument with someone and find yourself thinking, “oh my god why don’t you understand?! The evidence is right there!”? Facts alone don’t win arguments. Persuasion wins arguments."

Do not allow yourself to be distracted by anything off topic (which good debaters will try to do, of course).\nDefine the terms of the debate. Resolutions, by their nature, have inherent ambiguities. Define and frame the resolution further in a way that is simultaneously fair and that gives you an argumentative advantage. Make the terms of the debate clear to the jury: what, for instance, should determine a winner and loser in the debate? What points does your side need to make and what points does the other side need to make to win? Tell the jury what it means to win the debate.\nIn oral debate presentation, clarity is key. Subtlety is not your friend. Be straight, simple, and to the point.\nDebates happen fast. Plan. Pay attention to your time. The debate can feel simultaneously short and long - a three minute constructive is plenty of time to say what you need to, so long as you plan well ahead of time. Use all of your time effectively but do not go over.\nSpeak quickly if you can, but above all else, be clear and calm.

More time spent in response is more time spent in your opponent’s frame of the debate terms, and less time in yours.\n\nIn questions, go on the offensive and ask questions that you know your opponents don’t have good answers for. Good examples of questions include:\n\nTesting assumptions: “Does your argument depend on . . .”\nHighlight tradeoffs: “Does your policy require sacrificing . . .”\nClarifications: “What exactly do you mean by . . .”\nLock in concessions: “Do you agree that . . .”\n\nIn responses, answer honestly, but remember that too much time in response is time that you’re not spending pressing your opponent on the weaknesses in their arguments. Many best responses tend to deflect quickly, rather than parry fully.2\n\nParry: “That’s wrong because . . .”\nDeflect: “Even if that were true, it doesn’t matter/doesn’t undermine our claim because . . .”\n\nRemember: The cross examination is more typically won by asking good questions rather than having good responses.

    "section": "AI and Learning",
    "text": "AI and Learning\nArtificial intelligence – in particular, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT – are incredibly useful tools. To get the mundane observation out of the way: they are likely to radically change the way we all work over the next several years, just like a variety of other technologies before them (see: the internet, the smartphone, the personal computer, electricity, the steam engine, the printing press, etc.) AI already has a ton of valuable use cases, including in education, data analysis, and research, and the possibilities are only growing.1 There are also lots of concerns about AI’s destructive potential, especially for higher education.2\nI do not think AI is the end of higher education. However, I do think that, for you as a student to make most effective use of AI, it’s also important to understand exactly what AI is and how to use it in a way that is both (1) effective and (2) does not hamstring your learning. Current AI models are what is known as Large Language Models, or LLMs. An LLM, at its core, is a probabilistic model whose primary function is to produce the next token – which you can think of as a word – that is most likely to make sense in a sentence or phrase, based upon the input prompt and some surrounding context. It is not an “intelligence” like a human is, and it does not care if this token represents truth, reality, or a functional line of code – it only cares if the next token seems to make sense. Frequently, what it produces will be incidentally true and/or functional. That is what makes it useful! Occasionally, it will also produce nonsense (or what we know as a “hallucination”). LLMs have advised people to eat rocks and hold cheese on pizza with glue; they have failed to perform simple arithmetic with decimals; and they have made up wholly invented bibliographic references, statistical libraries, and analysis results.\nFurthermore, this incidental relationship to the real world is by design – it is inherent to the way LLMs work. They don’t verify what they say with base reality, they just spit out what sounds good to probabilistic algorithms.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA Humorous Academic Note\n\n\n\nLLMs are, in a philosophical sense, bullshit of the first order. And yes: “bullshit” here is a technical academic term, meaning “language produced without regard for truth.”4\n“The problem here isn’t that large language models hallucinate, lie, or misrepresent the world in some way. It’s that they are not designed to represent the world at all; instead, they are designed to convey convincing lines of text.” (Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, 2024)\nAnd yes, for those interested, the fact that this is from an academic research paper is what makes your normally proper and somewhat profanity-averse professor feel gleefully authorized to use the term “bullshit” in a course syllabus.5 There is a more diplomatic and professional seeming word that some use for the profusion of misguided output of AI: slop, which most use to mean the profusion and explosion of low-quality AI material. In short, they mean a profusion of what philosophy so artfully frames as bullshit. But with such a pithy and expressive alternative available to us in the English language, why limit ourselves to using the banal sounding “slop”?\n\n\nThis incidental relationship LLMs have with truth is also what makes relying on an LLM dangerous. You can’t reliably evaluate LLM outputs until you already know enough about a subject to judge good use of language from bad use of language. However, in the very beginning phases of learning, the problem is often that you don’t yet know enough about the subject to reliably evaluate the quality of AI outputs.\nFor instance, using LLMs early on in your learning can hamper your ability to understand the fundamental conceptual elements of programming and statistics.6 Many of your assignments for data classes, for instance, are intentionally created to give you practice on beginning concepts - concepts that ChatGPT can answer in a trivially easy fashion. Practice is what gives you familiarity and comfort and working knowledge, but practice doesn’t happen if you just copy language or code that an AI gives you.\nEven more problematically, it is these beginning concepts which, when well understood, would eventually enable your most effective use of this new class of tools for statistical and data work! Accordingly, if you elect to use generative AI to help you with assignments, I strongly encourage you to use them intelligently, rather than carelessly. Use them to help you learn, not to replace your learning; think of them like an interlocutor or teaching assistant, not like an answer bot. Even if plugging an assignment prompt directly into ChatGPT gives you an immediate shortcut, it is likely to put you at a long-term disadvantage, even when using AI, when compared to students that learned the old school way.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantResponsible AI\n\n\n\nRemember: whenever you use AI tools for a project you attach your name to, you are still taking implicit responsibility for that project, product, or document. This means that it is incumbent upon you to do the follow-up work necessary to validate, verify, and confirm that the language and work produced by the machine that works without regard for truth actually is accurate and functional. AI is not a coauthor,8 and I promise you that OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, etc won’t take responsibility for whatever you produce with their tools - that’s on you.9\nJust like any other tool or source you use, all use of AI, in anything you turn in for this class, should be documented and identified in your work. If you used AI to help you write code, note you used AI to help you write code. If you use it to help you write analysis, note how you used it to help you write analysis."

    "text": "Suggestions and Guidelines: AI usage in our course\nFor the reasons above, I would strongly encourage you to be skeptical and not overuse AI as you learn. My job, goal, and interest in this class is to help you, my human student, learn how to do valuable things like write code; wrangle and visualize data; critically interpret information; and learn how to be a more effective citizen and human engaging in the study of data analysis, data management, politics, and policy. My interest is not in correcting AI slop,10 nor does my interest lie in trying to figure out if you are attempting to pass unadulterated AI slop11 off as your own work.12 After all, you are allowed to use AI on assignments, if you wish, and I encourage you to do so in productive and valuable ways to enhance your learning, rather than as a way to cheat. Your education, as always, is only as valuable as what you put into it.\nWith all of that said, poor uses of AI are often easily detectable to the eye of me, your professor, and get bad grades regardless.13 Some examples:\n\nStudents who turn in papers and problem sets that reference methodological tools or techniques far beyond the understanding of the material they show in person or on in-class tests and assignments. (I’ve seen many students propose using methods that would only come to them in their third or fourth semester of statistics in an introductory research methods class, for instance.)\nStudents who successfully complete coding assignments, but do so in ways that are overly verbose and complicated relative to simpler and more straightforward methods and techniques covered in class.\nStudents who authoritatively reference scholars who don’t exist, or authoritatively reference scholars that exist but articles or books that those scholars never wrote.\nStudents who turn in assignments that match the style of documents that are well represented in the training set of an LLM (like a five paragraph essay, for instance) but do so for an assignment where the directions were clearly for something else (like, say, a Socratic dialogue.)\n\nIf you do such things in your work, you will find that I take points off not necessarily because you used AI, but because you’ve made a poor use of AI, and the work doesn’t meet the standards of the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningAn Aside on Grading\n\n\n\nI would also encourage you to not make the mistake of confusing assessement with learning.14 Assessment is an obligation of your professor to measure how well you know class material, but assessment is not the end goal of education any more than taking your blood pressure is the end goal of going to a physician’s office. The goal of an education is for you to learn and enhance your critical thinking in ways that will enrich your personal and professional lives. Don’t mistake the means for the end: I don’t care about assessing what ChatGPT “thinks” about something any more than your physician cares about measuring what ChatGPT’s blood pressure is, and I would suggest that you probably don’t care much about that, either.\nUse AI like a tool, keep your thinking your own, and remember: your education is about your own enrichment, not about passing some tests and assignments."

Second, you seem like the sort of person that might be interested in some further recommendations, readings, and resources on AI use and policy. The first place I would point you is to courses available to you at Maxwell and Syracuse. I teach this course in AI Policy, Professor Himmelreich teaches a class on Data Ethics, and Professor Zhang teaches a class on AI Governance and Politics. There are also a broader set of other AI-related things happening at Syracuse, including events through the Autonomous Systems Policy Institute (ASPI), resources organized by ITS, and many more.\nA few other things I’d recommend:\n\nMelanie Mitchell, professor at the Santa Fe Institute and one of the most nuanced thinkers about AI I know, has a series of articles that are well worth reading as well as an excellent podcast she hosted on AI. She was also interviewed for the excellently titled “How Your Cheese-Powered Baby Trounces AI”.\nAndrew Heiss, a professor in public management and policy at Georgia State’s Andrew Young School, has a digression on AI and education that’s worth looking through, including the sources and footnotes.\nGary Marcus’ substack is generally critical of current AI technology, but a good place to keep up on current AI trends and hype. Luiza Jarovsky’s substack is a good place to read about AI governance.\nIf you’re more interested in the business and tech industry sides of AI, Benjamin Evans and Ben Thompson are worth adding to your bookmarks/RSS reader/email inbox/future mechanism for keeping track of internet news that hasn’t yet been invented.\n\nFinally, as I’m always eager to know how far students actually read syllabi: if you have reached this point, and are still reading about AI and my thoughts on it, send me an email with a recommendation for your favorite artificial intelligence related novel, movie, or TV show. I’ll give you a bonus point on your next test."

If you’re paying attention to some of the details with AI, you know about something called an LRM - or Large Reasoning Model. To a first approximation, they try to introduce better and more complex reasoning into the base prediction process, sometimes going so far as to do things like generate Python code to do math and statistical analysis. These “reasoning” models, however, still often fall short on relatively simple reasoning tasks (see Apple, 2025, The Illusion of Thinking).↩︎\nFrankfurt, 2005, On Bullshit; Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, 2024, ChatGPT is Bullshit. For those interested in a full taxonomy, Frankfurt helpfully helps us distinguish between bullshit and any number of additional similar-but-different not-quite-truthisms, including humbug, hot air, bluff, bravado, and lying.↩︎\nFor another excellent example of profanity being used ever so eloquently in academia, see Healy, 2017, “Fuck Nuance”, which genuinely contains very good advice on writing. (Although to be fair, you can also get most of the point of that article just from the title . . . which is also the point.)↩︎\nSee, for instance, Lehmann, Cornelius, and Sting, 2024↩︎\nThere’s no school like the old school. Insert proper “value of doing the tough work” metaphor here: eating your vegetables, walking uphill both ways to school in a snowstorm, learning to program in assembly before C, etc.↩︎\nMany publications, for instance, have explicit and clear instructions that prevent you from cheekily listing ChatGPT or Claude as a coauthor, in fact - even if they allow for the use of ChatGPT in the production of the manuscript. See, for instance, this discussion in regards to journals published by Springer-Nature.↩︎\nA good parallel here is Microsoft Office: if you write some nonsensical hot garbage in Word, Microsoft is never going to take responsiblity for any of that business. They’ll (correctly) note that it was just some dumb human that wrote it using their tool.↩︎\nAn arduous, unending, and unenviable task, like Sisyphus with his rock.↩︎\nAI slop: also known as, well, you know.↩︎\nAccordingly, I will generally not spend time trying to guess if your assignments are improperly AI generated, nor will I typically engage with technology that purports to do this for me. The technical tools that try to detect LLM writing are imperfect, anyway, resulting in a lot of uncertainty and false positives.↩︎\nGood, and effective, AI usage often has the property of being largely undetectable, even to a trained eye – that’s often part of what makes it an effective use of the tool, actually!↩︎\nAn all too common mistake made today by many people, for the record. Much of the pearl-clutching around AI in education is really focused on how we can know or detect whether or not students are “cheating” on test and assignments, and less about how we can actually integrate AI meaningfully into the learning process.↩︎"

    "section": "General Tips and Advice",
    "text": "General Tips and Advice\n\nRefer to the other team as “our opponents” or “my opponent”.\nThink carefully about the resolution. What exactly is the resolution asking you to debate? Do not allow yourself to be distracted by anything off topic (which good debaters will try to do, of course).\n\nThe only thing you need to do to beat an genuinely off topic argument is say “Judge, please disregard my opponent’s contention because it is off topic.” (Of course, if the jury does not think that a contention is off topic, this may backfire.)\n\nDefine the terms of the debate. Resolutions, by their nature, have inherent ambiguities. Define and frame the resolution further in a way that is simultaneously fair and that gives you an argumentative advantage. Make the terms of the debate clear to the judges: what, for instance, should determine a winner and loser in the debate? What points does your side need to make and what points does the other side need to make to win?\nIn oral debate presentation, clarity is key. Subtlety is not your friend. Use the following format for your constructive speech:\n\nClaim I (The first point you argue. Literally say, “Our first claim is that . . . “)\n\nWarrant (“This is true because…”)\nEvidence\nImpact (“This is important because…”)\n\nClaim II (The second point you argue)\n\nWarrant\nEvidence\nImpact\n\nClaim III (The third point you argue)\n\nWarrant\nEvidence\nImpact\n\n\nIn cross examination, avoid the trap of over explaining or over questioning. The most memorable points are quick and pithy. If you’re asking too long a question, both the other team and the jury will lose track of what you’re asking. (You have all other parts of the debate to speech-ify. This is your time to exract concessions from your opponents directly.)\nIn questions, go on the offensive and ask questions that you know your opponents don’t have good answers for. Good examples of questions include:\n\nTesting assumptions: “Does your argument depend on . . .”\nHighlight tradeoffs: “Does your policy require sacrificing . . .”\nClarifications: “What exactly do you mean by . . .”\nLock in concessions: “Do you agree that . . .”\n\nIf you’re over explaining in response, you’re probably losing. More time spent in response is more time spent in your opponents debate frame, and less time in yours. Answer honestly, but remember that too much time in reponse is time that you’re not spending pressing your opponent on the weaknesses in their arguments.\nRemember: The cross examination is more typically won by asking good questions rather than having good responses. Prepare accordingly.\nThe rebuttal and final focus have different purposes. The rebuttal is where you tell the judge and jury why your opponents are wrong and you are right. The final focus is where you focus the judge on jury on why you should win the debate.\nUse the similar format for your rebuttal and final focus:\n\nMy opponent’s arguments are incorrect becuase/here is why we’ve won today’s round:\n\nReason (Tell the jury very literally why they should vote for you)\nReason\nReason\n\n\nPay attention to your time. The debate can feel simultaneously short and long - a three minute constructive is plenty of time to say what you need to, so long as you plan well ahead of time. Use all of your time effectively but do not go over.\nSpeak quickly if you can, but above all else be clear and calm. If you want to perform well you must practice giving your constructive speech at least twice.\nUse resources from class, including readings and lectures, as well as material from outside class. Consider the optional readings listed in the course agenda. They are there to help you.\nRemember: if you want to win, you need to focus on persuading your judges. How many times have you been in an argument with someone and find yourself thinking, “oh my god why don’t you understand?! The evidence is right there!”? Facts alone don’t win arguments. Persuasion wins arguments."

    "text": "Judge’s Notes\nIt may help to think of this debate as a warm-up and illustration of the debate format. Later debates typically take place over more substantive policy disputes, with a potential greater role for evidence; this first debate is meant to illustrate the form of debate itself. It can help, for instance, to think about how you might have a debate over similar “debate training” resolutions, like:\n\n“A hot dog is a sandwich”\n“Cereal is a soup”\n“Peppers are fruits”\n“Pluto should be classified as a planet”\n“Chess is a sport”\n“Coffee is better than tea”\n“Breakfast food is superior to dinner food”\n\nYou should expect that much of this debate will turn on how key terms like “intelligence” and “passing the Turing Test” are defined. It’s not that there is no role for evidence in these resolutions - there is - but evidentiary proof is secondary to argumentative structure and strategy in winning these kinds of “training” debates. Remember, the goal is not to be correct: the goal is to make the best case possible under reasonable definitions (and learn something substantive about both sides of a debate along the way).",

No coding will be required in the course.\nSyracuse University has a campus-wide license to the enterprise version of Anthropic’s Claude, which gives you increased usage before your compute is limited. Anthropic also guarantees Syracuse that it will not train Claude’s models on your data. I recommend you use it when asked in course assignments if you do not have higher-level access to another LLM.

    "text": "📌 Course Requirements\n\nOverview\n\nSeminar Participation (20%)\n\nAttendance, Reading, and Participation\nDiscussion Questions\nAI News Submissions\nDiscussion Leadership\n\nPrepared Work for Class (40%)\n\nDebates (30%)\nShort Assignments (10%)\n\nCore Exam (20%)\nFinal Project (20%)\n\nPresentation\nPaper\n\n\n\n\nSeminar Participation\n\nDaily Attendance, Participation, and Reading\nThis is a preceptorial-style seminar taught at a high level: it only works if everyone takes part. I have a high opinion of your intellectual capability and a similarly high opinion of the quality of your potential contributions - make sure to show them to me!\n\n\nDiscussion Questions\nSubmit discussion questions or points (broadly construed) to the class by 9 AM on the day of class. Make sure to send messages to the course Teams chat so everyone can read them.\n\n\nAI News Submissions\nIn class, we’ll occasionally use time in class to discuss AI news from the week. (Especially if something particularly interesting happens . . . which, because this is AI, happens a lot). If you come across interesting AI news - or broad tech industry news - submit it to our Teams chat.\n\n\nDiscussion Leadership\nEach class has an assigned discussion leader from among the students. While all students are under an obligation to read (or listen, or watch) the material each day from class, the discussion leader has a special role as the person who starts our discussion for the day rolling, and steps in should our discussion of the day’s material falter.\n\n\nParticipation Grading Policy\nA seminar like this doesn’t work if everyone only seeks to do the bare minimum. Informed class participation is expected and required each day in class; you shouldn’t be counting things like “I submitted a number of news articles already this semester, so I no longer need to submit news articles or talk in class”. Participate across all elements of the seminar as and when the spirit moves you, and keep that participation up through the semester, and you’ll do fine for this portion of the class.2\nWith that said, it is useful to have some baselines and expectations for everyone to keep in mind. A few that are useful:\n\nAttendance: One of the guiding principles of my class is that you are adults, and thus, capable of managing your own obligations and time. I have little interest in policing your lives, and I understand that everyone has bad days, things that come up, etc.3 You can miss up to three days of class without excuse or penalty, unless that day is a day you have a special obligation. If you are supposed to be a discussion leader, or giving a presentation, taking part in a debate, or miss more than three days, make sure to send me a note.\n\nDiscussion Questions: At least one each day. (Although do note: you should sometimes submit more than one, too!)\nIn-Class Participation: We should hear your contributions every day. We’ll have systems in class to make sure that everyone gets a turn. I won’t be keeping exact tallies of who said what, or how much, but I will take note of your general contribution tendencies.\n\nNews Submissions: At least two news submissions per semester (hopefully more)!\nDiscussion Leadership: Split evenly according to the number of students in the class.\n\n\n\n\nPrepared Class Work\n\nDebates\nWe will have six formal debates in the class, following a modified Lincoln-Douglas debate format (if you are unfamiliar with these rules, don’t worry! We’ll cover them.) Each student will have a role in each debate, although not all roles are equal: it is easier to judge than it is to affirm or negate. All students will have equal debate responsibilities across the class.\n\n\nShort Assignments\nSmall assignments about AI tools will be given throughout the semester. They may involve presentations to the class.\n\n\n\nCore Exam\nAn in class test on AI basics, held in the middle of the semester.\n\n\nFinal Project\nA final research project on an aspect of AI policy. (There will be options.) Graduate students will have higher expectations than undergraduates."

    "text": "🎓 Course Expectations & Guidelines\n\nEtiquette & Decorum\nThis is an upper level undergraduate and graduate course: I take it for granted that you have a basic interest in the material and an enthusiastic attitude toward participation. A university classroom is fundamentally a learning community that operates on respect: be courteous to fellow students and the professor, attend class on time, listen to fellow seminar participants when they talk, and disagree (or agree) with others’ arguments professionally. Keep cell phones and other technology silenced and out of sight unless doing something directly relevant to the discussion in the class.4\n\n\nOffice & Consultation Hours, Appointments\nI encourage you to chat with me at any point if you have questions about the course. You are always welcome to drop by my office hours, and can schedule a meeting with me by going to my website here: http://jacklreilly.github.io. You do not need an appointment for regularly scheduled drop-in office hours: they are there for you! Furthermore, I have a general open-door policy: feel free to stop by to see if my door is open, and if it is, just come on in. (Don’t feel like you’re intruding! I’ll tell you if it’s not a good time.)\n\n\nE-mail\nEmail is the best way to contact me. I try to be pretty responsive, but as a baseline, I always aim to get back to you in a modified 24-hour fashion: by the end of the business day the day after you email (at minimum). So if you email me at 2 PM Tuesday, I’ll get back to you by 6 PM Wednesday at the latest; if 10 PM Thursday, by 6 PM Friday; if you email me at 3 PM on Friday, by 6 PM Monday, etc.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your email requires a long response, expect me to encourage you to meet with me in person so we can have a more effective discussion.\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Class Technology Policy\nTo be discussed (and decided upon!) in class on a per-assignment basis."

    "text": "🏫 Campus Academic Resources & Policies\nThe following reflects the approved campus-wide academic policies of Syracuse University. For more information and detail, please consult the full documentation of University policies here.\n\n⚠️ Academic Drop Deadline\nAs part of our efforts to track satisfactory academic progress, the Academic Drop Deadline and the Financial Drop Deadline will both occur on September 15, 2025, for the fall semester and February 2, 2026, for the spring semester. Students may still withdraw from courses after these deadlines; this would place a ‘WD’ grade on their transcripts. Students enrolled in “flex” classes (Flexibly formatted classes) have different deadlines and will need to check MySlice for the Academic and Financial Drop deadlines that pertain to their class.\n\n\n📖 Academic Integrity\nAs a pre-eminent and inclusive student-focused research institution, Syracuse University considers academic integrity at the forefront of learning, serving as a core value and guiding pillar of education. Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy provides students with the necessary guidelines to complete academic work with integrity throughout their studies. Students are required to uphold both course-specific and university-wide academic integrity expectations such as crediting your sources, doing your own work, communicating honestly, and supporting academic integrity. The full Syracuse University Academic Integrity Policy can be viewed by visiting the Syracuse University Policies website.\nUpholding Academic Integrity includes the protection of faculty’s intellectual property. Students should not upload, distribute, or share instructors’ course materials, including presentations, assignments, exams, or other evaluative materials without permission. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others, which are then presented as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation. All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person assignments, quizzes, and exams also apply online.\nStudents found in violation of the policy are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. Students may not drop or withdraw from courses in which they face a suspected violation. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\n\n\n🤖 Artificial Intelligence\nBased on the specific learning outcomes and assignments in this course, artificial intelligence is permitted on the following: selected course assignments. Artificial intelligence is not permitted on in-class exams. See each assignment, quiz, or exam instructions for more information about what artificial intelligence tools are permitted and to what extent, as well as citation requirements. If no instructions are provided for a specific assignment, then no use of any artificial intelligence tool is permitted. Any AI use beyond that which is detailed in course assignments is explicitly prohibited except when documented permission is granted.\nPlease also see Syracuse University’s general campus AI policies here.\nI, as the instructor, may use generative AI tools to help develop course materials. When I do, I take full responsibility for reviewing and verifying all AI-generated content to ensure it is accurate, appropriate and aligned with our learning objectives. All final course materials represent my professional judgment about what will best support your learning.\n\n\n💻 Academic Integrity Online\nAll academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.\nUsing websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation, resulting in suspension or expulsion from Syracuse University.\n\n\n👤 Attendance Policy\nAttendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. It is a federal requirement that faculty promptly notify the university of students who do not attend or cease to attend any class. Faculty will use Early-Semester Progress Reports and Mid-Semester Progress Reports in Orange SUccess to alert the Registrar and Financial Aid Office on non-attendance. For more information visit:\nFaculty: Information for Faculty: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending Students: Information for Students: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending\nIf a student is unable to participate in-person or virtually for an extended period of time (48 hours or more), the student may request an absence notification from their home school/college Dean’s Office or through Student Outreach and Support office. Instructors will be notified via the “Absence Notification” flag in Orange SUccess.\nBarnes Center at the Arch (Health, Counseling, etc.) staff will not provide medical excuse notes for students. When Barnes Center staff determine it is medically necessary to remove a student from classes, they will coordinate with Student Outreach and Support case management staff to provide appropriate notification to faculty through Orange Success. For absences lasting less than 48 hours, students are encouraged to discuss academic arrangements directly with their faculty.\nAdditional information may be found at Student Outreach and Support: Absence Notifications.\n\n\n🖼 Blackboard\nThis class will use the Blackboard Learning Management to house the syllabus, course content, links to external course materials, assignments, quizzes, exams, feedback, and grades. Due dates and times in Blackboard are stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and displayed for each user based on the time zone setting of their computer and data from their internet browser. The system will always display the time zone being used. If an instructor sets a due date of 11pm Eastern time, a student in the Pacific time zone will see a due date of 8pm.”\nInformation about Blackboard is available on Answers Blackboard; alternatively, you can contact Information Technology Services by sending an email to help@syr.edu, calling 315.443.2677, or in-person at the ITS Service Center, located at 1-227 CST in the Life Sciences Complex. Business hours for the Service Center can be found on the ITS website.\n\n\n🚫 Discrimination and Harassment\nThe University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, reproductive health decisions, disability, marital status, political or social affiliation, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender.\nAny complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer for Faculty and Staff. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under the various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 621 Skytop Road, Suite 1001, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244-1120; or by email: equalopp@syr.edu; or by telephone: 315-443-4018.\n\n\n🌍 Diversity\nIt is the intent of this course for students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives to be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is also critical to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let your instructor know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.\n\n\n🤝 Disability\nSyracuse University values access and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be necessary to ensure equitable access, and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process.\nIf you would like to discuss disability-related accommodations or register with CDR, please visit Center for Disability Resources. Please call 315.443.4498 or email CDRspecialist@syr.edu for more detailed information.\nCDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations are generally not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible to initiate this process.\n\n\n🌐 Faith and Religious Accommodations\nSyracuse University’s Religious Observances Policy recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holy days according to their traditions. Under the policy, students are given an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance, provided they notify their instructors no later than the academic drop deadline. For observances occurring before the drop deadline, notification is required at least two academic days in advance. Students may enter their observances in MySlice under Student Services/Enrollment/My Religious Observances/Add a Notification.\n\n\n📝 FERPA\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) sets forth requirements regarding the privacy of student records. FERPA governs both the access to and release of those records, known as education records, and the information they contain. Under FERPA, faculty have a legal responsibility to protect the confidentiality of student records. For additional information about FERPA and Syracuse University’s FERPA policy, see Compliance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act or contact the Office of the Registrar (315.443.2422).\n\n\n🩺 Health and Wellness\nWell-being and mental health are significant predictors of academic success. It is critical to take care of yourself physically and emotionally and to effectively navigate stress, anxiety, and depression. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the Barnes Center provides https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/ and seek out support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are available 24/7, 365 days, at 315-443-8000.\n\n\n🍊 ORANGE Alert\nORANGE ALERT, Syracuse University’s crisis notification system, uses text messages, phone, and email alerts to provide rapid notification and instructions to members of the University community in the event of a crisis in progress. In the event of an emergency, please use one of the following numbers to reach us:\nFrom any phone: 315.443.2224 From your cell phone: #78 (#SU) Campus landline: 711\nFor more information on ORANGE ALERT, including how to update your contact information, visit the DPS website."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nIn addition to formal office hours, I have an open door policy - feel free to stop by if you see the door open. In particular, I stay around after class for up to half an hour if students come by - feel free to stay after and meet with me.↩︎\nFor the grade for this section, I hope and expect to be able to simply award full points to everyone based on apparent enthusiasm and contributions across the whole semester.↩︎\nI also understand that some of these things that come up may be things you don’t want to discuss with your professor. That’s OK! The attendance policy is designed so that you typically don’t have to tell me you missed because you have a medical emergency or a family matter you’d rather not discuss.↩︎\nRemember that technology presents a significant negative externality: it is not just you that is distracted, but it is you who are distracting others as well with the bright shiny colors on your screen.↩︎\nUsually I aim to be much much faster! But if you don’t hear from me by this baseline, feel free to bump a reminder. No hard feelings. Sometimes things get busy and I lose track of an email.↩︎"
