It presumes no particular prior knowledge of artificial intelligence, political science, public policy, or computer science; rather, it will introduce students to what artificial intelligence is as well as to the ethics of AI, its social implications, and the policy choices around AI that currently face governments, corporations, and organizations worldwide.

First, we start with an introduction to the philosophy of artificial intelligence itself. What is “intelligence” and “consciousness” in the first place? What are minds? What are agents and legal persons, and when are agents responsible for their actions? What is artificial intelligence, and what is artificial “general” intelligence? Second, we proceed to discuss the mechanics of current computational approaches to AI, with a particular focus on large language models (such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT), including approachable, non-technical overviews of the principles behind machine learning, neural networks, and assorted technologies that have given rise to the current state of the art in AI. Third, we consider the societal impacts of current artificial intelligence systems, including data practices as well as current AI applications, uses, risks, and ethics. Fourth, we turn to policy, examining the decisions in front of governments, companies, and organizations in the United States and worldwide as well as complications in the policy process for producing effective AI legislation.\n\n\n\nIntroductory coursework in (any) related area(s). No particular knowledge is expected, but the reading level is high and this course may not be suitable for first year students.\nWhile this course has no formal pre-requisites, it does have a substantial informal prerequisite: motivation.

Mind Design III: Philosophy, Psychology, and Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n\n\nComputing\nWe will make use of AI models in class as end-users, so you should have a computer you can use to access them. No coding will be required in the course.\nSyracuse University has a campus-wide license to the enterprise version of Anthropic’s Claude, which gives you increased usage before your compute is limited. Anthropic also guarantees Syracuse that it will not train Claude’s models on your data. I recommend you use it when asked in course assignments if you do not have higher-level access to another LLM.

In it, you will find submission portals for assignments and a link to our course webpage, along with (potentially) a few resources that are copyright protected and not suitable to post here.\n\n\nMicrosoft Teams\nIn addition to Blackboard, we’ll have a class discussion channel in Microsoft Teams for discussion question sharing as well as for sharing news articles.

    "text": "📌 Course Requirements\n\nOverview\n\nSeminar Participation (20%)\n\nAttendance, Reading, and Participation\nDiscussion Questions\nAI News Submissions\nDiscussion Leadership\n\nPrepared Work for Class (40%)\n\nDebates (30%)\nShort Assignments (10%)\n\nCore Exam (20%)\nFinal Project (20%)\n\nPresentation\nPaper\n\n\n\n\nSeminar Participation\n\nDaily Attendance, Participation, and Reading\nThis is a preceptorial-style seminar taught at a high level: it only works if everyone takes part. I have a high opinion of your intellectual capability and a similarly high opinion of the quality of your potential contributions - make sure to show them to me!\n\n\nDiscussion Questions\nSubmit discussion questions or points (broadly construed) to the class by 9 AM on the day of class. Make sure to send messages to the course Teams chat so everyone can read them.\n\n\nAI News Submissions\nIn class, we’ll occasionally use time in class to discuss AI news from the week. (Especially if something particularly interesting happens . . . which, because this is AI, happens a lot). If you come across interesting AI news - or broad tech industry news - submit it to our Teams chat.\n\n\nDiscussion Leadership\nEach class has an assigned discussion leader from among the students. While all students are under an obligation to read (or listen, or watch) the material each day from class, the discussion leader has a special role as the person who starts our discussion for the day rolling, and steps in should our discussion of the day’s material falter.\n\n\nParticipation Grading Policy\nA seminar like this doesn’t work if everyone only seeks to do the bare minimum. Informed class participation is expected and required each day in class; you shouldn’t be counting things like “I submitted a number of news articles already this semester, so I no longer need to submit news articles or talk in class”. Participate across all elements of the seminar as and when the spirit moves you, and keep that participation up through the semester, and you’ll do fine for this portion of the class.2\nWith that said, it is useful to have some baselines and expectations for everyone to keep in mind. A few that are useful:\n\nAttendance: One of the guiding principles of my class is that you are adults, and thus, capable of managing your own obligations and time. I have little interest in policing your lives, and I understand that everyone has bad days, things that come up, etc.3 You can miss up to three days of class without excuse or penalty, unless that day is a day you have a special obligation. If you are supposed to be a discussion leader, or giving a presentation, taking part in a debate, or miss more than three days, make sure to send me a note.\n\nDiscussion Questions: At least one each day. (Although do note: you should sometimes submit more than one, too!)\nIn-Class Participation: We should hear your contributions every day. We’ll have systems in class to make sure that everyone gets a turn. I won’t be keeping exact tallies of who said what, or how much, but I will take note of your general contribution tendencies.\n\nNews Submissions: At least two news submissions per semester (hopefully more)!\nDiscussion Leadership: Split evenly according to the number of students in the class.\n\n\n\n\nPrepared Class Work\n\nDebates\nWe will have six formal debates in the class, following a modified Lincoln-Douglas debate format (if you are unfamiliar with these rules, don’t worry! We’ll cover them.) Each student will have a role in each debate, although not all roles are equal: it is easier to judge than it is to affirm or negate. All students will have equal debate responsibilities across the class.\n\n\nShort Assignments\nSmall assignments about AI tools will be given throughout the semester. They may involve presentations to the class.\n\n\n\nCore Exam\nAn in class test on AI basics, held in the middle of the semester.\n\n\nFinal Project\nA final research project on an aspect of AI policy. (There will be options.) Graduate students will have higher expectations than undergraduates."

    "text": "🎓 Course Expectations & Guidelines\n\nEtiquette & Decorum\nThis is an upper level undergraduate and graduate course: I take it for granted that you have a basic interest in the material and an enthusiastic attitude toward participation. A university classroom is fundamentally a learning community that operates on respect: be courteous to fellow students and the professor, attend class on time, listen to fellow seminar participants when they talk, and disagree (or agree) with others’ arguments professionally. Keep cell phones and other technology silenced and out of sight unless doing something directly relevant to the discussion in the class.4\n\n\nOffice & Consultation Hours, Appointments\nI encourage you to chat with me at any point if you have questions about the course. You are always welcome to drop by my office hours, and can schedule a meeting with me by going to my website here: http://jacklreilly.github.io. You do not need an appointment for regularly scheduled drop-in office hours: they are there for you! Furthermore, I have a general open-door policy: feel free to stop by to see if my door is open, and if it is, just come on in. (Don’t feel like you’re intruding! I’ll tell you if it’s not a good time.)\n\n\nE-mail\nEmail is the best way to contact me. I try to be pretty responsive, but as a baseline, I always aim to get back to you in a modified 24-hour fashion: by the end of the business day the day after you email (at minimum). So if you email me at 2 PM Tuesday, I’ll get back to you by 6 PM Wednesday at the latest; if 10 PM Thursday, by 6 PM Friday; if you email me at 3 PM on Friday, by 6 PM Monday, etc.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your email requires a long response, expect me to encourage you to meet with me in person so we can have a more effective discussion.\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Class Technology Policy\nTo be discussed (and decided upon!) in class on a per-assignment basis."

    "section": "AI and Learning",
    "text": "AI and Learning\nI have a lot of thoughts about this.1\nArtificial intelligence – in particular, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT – are incredibly useful tools. To get the mundane observation out of the way: they are likely to radically change the way we all work over the next several years, just like a variety of other technologies before them (see: the internet, the smartphone, the personal computer, electricity, the steam engine, the printing press, etc.) AI already has a ton of valuable use cases, including in education, data analysis, and research, and the possibilites are only growing.2\nHowever, to make most effective use of AI, it’s also important to understand exactly what AI is. Current AI models are what is known as Large Language Models, or LLMs. An LLM, at its core, is a probabilistic model whose primary function is to produce the next token – usually a word – that is most likely to make sense, based upon some prompt. It does not care if this token represents truth, reality, or a functional line of code – it only cares if the next token seems to make sense. Frequently, what it produces will incidentally be true and/or functional. That is what makes it useful! Frequently, it will also produce nonsense (or what we formally know as a “hallucination”). LLMs have advised people to eat rocks, hold cheese on pizza with glue, failed to perform simple arithmetic with decimals, and made up wholly invented bibliographic references, statistical libraries, and analysis results.\nFurthermore, this incidental relationship to the real world is by design – it is inherent to the way LLMs work. They don’t verify what they say with base reality, they just spit out what sounds good to probabilistic algorithms.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA Very Academic Note\n\n\n\nLLMs are, in a formal sense, bullshit of the first order. And yes: “bullshit” here is a technical academic term, meaning “language produced without regard for truth.”4\n“The problem here isn’t that large language models hallucinate, lie, or misrepresent the world in some way. It’s that they are not designed to represent the world at all; instead, they are designed to convey convincing lines of text.” (Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, 2024)\nAnd yes, for those interested, the fact that this is from an academic research paper is what makes your normally proper and profanity-averse professor feel somewhat gleefully authorized to use the term “bullshit” in a syllabus.5 There is a more diplomatic and professional seeming word that some use for the profusion of misguided output of AI: slop, which most use to mean the profusion and explosion of low-quality AI material. In short, they mean a profusion of what Frankfurt so artfully frames as bullshit. But with such a pithy and expressive alternative available to us in the expressiveness of the English language, why limit ourselves to using the banal sounding “slop”?\n\n\nThis incidental relationship LLMs have with truth is also what makes relying on an LLM dangerous. You can’t reliably evaluate LLM outputs until you already know enough about a subject to judge good use of language from bad use of language. However, in the very beginning phases of learning how to write code, conduct data analysis, and interpret it, the problem is often that you don’t yet know enough about the subject to reliably evaluate the quality of AI outputs.\nFurthermore, using LLMs early on in your learning can hamper your ability to understand the fundamental conceptual elements of programming and statistics.6 Even more problematically, it is these concepts which, when will understood, will eventually enable your most effecive use of this new class of tools for statistical and data work! Accordingly, if you elect to use generative AI to help you with assignments, I strongly encourage you to use them intelligently, rather than carelessly. Use them to help you learn, not to replace your learning. Even if plugging an assignment prompt directly into ChatGPT gives you an immediate shortcut, it is likely put you at a long-term disadvantage, even when using AI, when compared to students that learned the old school way.7"

    "text": "Using AI Responsibly\nSo why am I waxing rhapsodic about the dangers of AI use? Is this simply a case of old man yells at cloud? Well, possibly.8 But not really. As we move forward with social life where everyone’s work is in collaboration with, or enhanced by, the use of varying kinds of technology and AI, one of the most critical elements for us to work on is not just how to use AI, but how to use AI responsibly, in a way that furthers our goals as policy analysts, academics, administrators, and communicators.9\nNow, this is not a class on how to use AI, nor on the ethical and responsible use of AI. (It’s a class on data.) But that doesn’t mean ethical and responsible use of AI is not important. There is little in ethics that is purely black and white, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t some very clear guidelines one should use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantResponsible AI\n\n\n\nWhenever you use AI tools for a project you attach your name to, you are still taking implicit responsiblity for that project, product, or document. This means that it is incumbent upon you to to the followup work necessary to validate, verify, and confirm that the language and work produced by the machine that works without regard for truth is accurate and functional. AI is not a coauthor,10 and I promise you that OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, etc won’t take responsibility for whatever you produce with their tools - that’s on you.11\nJust like any other tool or source you use, all use of AI, in anything you turn in for this class, should be documented and identified in your work. If you used AI to help you write code, note you used AI to help you write code. If you use it to help you write analysis, not how you used it to help you write analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionEffective AI use in Learning\n\n\n\nAny use of AI in learning environments should enhance, not take the place of, learning fundamental core concepts. Your goal in the class is to learn things important for your future career or for your general edification as a human and scholar; my goal is to do my level best to help you - not a machine - learn these things.\nIn other, more pithy words: don’t outsource the important process of your own learning critical thinking to the philosophical bullshit machine.12\n\n\nPhilosophical musings, however, can be difficult to wrap around practical usage. So, in case it is helpful, and in the interest of full disclosure, here are some of the ways that I use AI in my own work, along with some notes about the pitfalls and things I am careful about:\n\nI look up function calls or code syntax in programming languages I already understand well, and sometimes ask LLMs to write small code snippets for me. This is one of my more common use cases for AI professionally, and one that noticeably speeds things up for me - I can typically at a glance tell if some code I’m given is wonky, and can always validate and verify that the output of the code is what I expect. Note that I do not ask LLMs to write large chunk of code or whole programs for me, which would be more difficult for me to verify in a way that would leave me comfortable taking responsibility for the code.\nI regularly use AI to help me translate between different formats, programming languages, or coding schemes. Much of this syllabus, for instance, was first written in LaTeX, and later translated, with the help of ChatGPT, to quarto.\nI occasionally use agentic LLMs to try to find new literature on a topic. This is a fraught process, as LLMs will frequently make citations up, but it is still sometimes useful. The fact that I have to verify every citation makes this not terribly useful, though.\nI typically use AI in ways that induces extra friction between the AI generating process and my own work, which forces me to review it before inserting it into my document or code. Typically, this means I ask ChatGPT or Claude for things directly in the chatbot interface, and don’t go much into using tools that interface directly with my documetns or scripts (like Microsoft/Github Copilot).\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that my way is the only ethical way to use AI. (I think many people use Github Copilot in perfectly responsible ways, for instance.) But it is the way that I have found it most useful to use ChatGPT that strikes a balance between utility and awareness.\nNote a continued common feature here: LLMs are things I use as tools to enhance my own productivity, not as minds to replace my own.13 Despite the hype and publicity of certain AI companies and their founders, there are a number of good reasons to doubt that LLMs are anywhere near human level intelligence (or AGI, as many like to refer to it). There are even lots of good reasons to believe the entire concept of “reaching human intelligence” is fundamentally flawed - beliefs held by a number of cognitive scientists, psychologists, computer scientists, and philosophers with far more expertise in minds, brains, logic, and programming than you or me.\nAnother way to think of it: Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, had a favorite metahpor he liked to use when selling the virtues of computers: a computer, he claimed, is a bicycle for the mind. The advent of technical progress means that your ChatGPT-equipped Apple laptop may be more like an automobile (or even a rocket) for your mind, rather than a bicycle, but the parallel is still apt: neither the bicyle nor the automobile replaces your own mind; it merely augments it."

AI, I think – and LLMs in particular, as the current dominant instantiation of AI – is just the next technological jump forward. Whether it turns into a giant leap or a fumbling stumble, I think, is yet to be seen.14\nThat said, I also believe that, even in courses that are not directly about AI, one of my jobs as an educator is to help students learn how to use AI effectively. I don’t ban the use of AI in my class – except in ways that violate common decency, the law, or other educational or professional obligations – and even tacitly encourage it in some circumstances.\nI would, however, strongly encourage you to be skeptical and not overuse AI as you learn. I would also encourage you to not make the mistake of confusing assessement with learning.15 Assessment is an obligation of your professor to measure out how well you know class material, but assessment is not the end goal of education any more than taking your blood pressure is the end goal of going to a physician’s office. The goal of education is learning. Don’t mistake the means for the end: I don’t care about assessing what ChatGPT “thinks” about something any more than your physician cares about what ChatGPT’s blood pressure is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonePoor Uses of AI\n\n\n\nAs an aside, poor uses of AI are often easily detectable to the eye of your professor. Good, and effective, AI usage often has the property of being largely undetectable, even to a trained eye – that’s what makes it effective use of the tool, actually! But bad usage is often so obvious as to be painful. Some examples:\n\nStudents who turn in papers and problem sets that reference methodological tools or techniques way beyond the understanding of the material they show in person or in in-class tests and assignments. (I’ve seen many students propose using methods that would only come to them in their third or fourth semester of statistics in an introductory research methods class, for instance.)\nStudents who authoritatively reference scholars who don’t exist, or authoritatively reference scholars that exist but articles or books that those scholars never wrote.\nStudents who turn in assignments that match the style of documents that are well represented in the training set of an LLM (like a five paragraph essay, for instance) but do so for an assignment where the directions were clearly for something else (like, say, a Socratic dialogue.)\n\nIf you do such things in your work, you will find me take points off not necessarily because you used AI - which is typically allowed - but because you’ve made a poor use of AI, and the work doesn’t meet the standards of the class.\n\n\nFinally, my job, goal, and interest in this class is to help you, my human student, learn how to valuable things like write code; wrangle and visualize data; critically interpret information; and learn how to be a more effective citizen and human engaging in data analysis, management, and policy study. My interest is not in correcting AI slop,16 nor does my interest lie in trying to figure out if you are attempting to pass AI slop17 off as your own work. Accordingly, I will generally just not spend time trying to guess if your assignments are AI generated, nor will I typically engage with technology that purports to do this for me.18"

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nSo many thoughts, in fact, that I teach a whole class on AI Policy! Come take it with me in the spring if you’re interested.↩︎\nI for instance, used AI tools to help me build this website, and I would guess that I was able to do it at least twice as quickly as I would have been able to without AI.↩︎\nGenerally speaking, at least. If you’re paying attention to some of the details with AI, you know about something called an LRM - or Large Reasoning Model. To a first approximation, they try to introduce better and more complex reasoning into the base prediction process, sometimes going so far to do things like generate python code to do math analysis. These “reasoning” models, however, still often fall short on relatively simple reasoning tasks (see Apple, 2025, The Illusion of Thinking).↩︎\nFrankfurt, 2005, On Bullshit; Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, 2024, ChatGPT is Bullshit. For those interested in a full taxonomy, Frankfurt helpfully helps us distinguish between bullshit and any number of additional different not-quite-truthisms, including humbug, hot air, bluff, bravado, and lying.↩︎\nFor another excellent example of profanity being elegantly used to make forceful points in academic settings, see Healy, 2017, “Fuck Nuance”, which genuinely contains very good advice on writing. (Although to be fair, you can also get most of the point of that article just from the title . . . which is also the point.)↩︎\nSee, for instance, Lehmann, Cornelius, and Sting, 2024↩︎\nInsert proper “value of doing the tough work” metaphor here: eating your vegetables, walking uphill both ways to school in a snowstorm, learning to program in assembly before C, etc.↩︎\nYou never really know what you’re over the hill, after all. But you do feel it coming sooner every day.↩︎\nFor 99.9% of economically relevant labor, our ultimate goal remains to work with and for other humans and human society, after all.↩︎\nMany publications, for instance, have explict and clear instructions that prevent you from cheekily listing ChatGPT or Claude as a coauthor, in fact - even if they allow for the use of ChatGPT in the production of the manuscript. See, for instance, this discussion in regards to journals published by Springer-Nature.↩︎\nA good parallel here is Microsoft Office: if you write some nonsensible hot garbage in Word, Microsoft is never going to take responsiblity for any of that business. They’ll (correctly) note that it was just some dumb human that wrote it using their tool.↩︎\nAgain, an academic reference!↩︎\nAnother way to think about it: ChatGPT never writes a paragraph for me, but it does occasionally help me find the right word I’m looking for (like a dictionary) or identify the right way to use particular commands in code (like stackoverflow).↩︎\nFor the record, my money would be somewhere much more than “fumbling stumble” but not quite “giant leap” - perhaps “two steps forward and one step back”? Either way, however, I don’t think much is gained from preventing students from using AI. It’s just the next tool in the chain, and it’s not like you see people walking around all day using a slide rule or abacus. Technology marches on in fits and starts regardless.↩︎\nAn all too common mistake made today by many people, for the record.↩︎\nAn arduous, unending, and unenviable task, like Sisyphus with his rock.↩︎\nAI slop: also known as, well, you know.↩︎\nThe technical tools that try to detect LLM writing are imperfect, anyways, resulting in a lot of uncertainty and false positives. Furthermore, experience has taught me that typically, poor used and generated LLM content will often earn poor marks, regardless, and have some pretty clear “tells”. This means I don’t have to care too much if you produce bad work with AI or bad work without AI: it’s just bad work. And your learning, in the final anlaysis, really is up to you. If you want to cut corners and use AI irresponsibly, there’s nothing I can do to stop you. (It’s really just future you that you’re hurting, anyways.) If you want to use LLMs responsibly successfully, well: great! That’s probably the way of the future, anyways, and I hope that this document, along with other elements of my and others’ classes, help you learn how to do so successfully.↩︎"

    "text": "AI and Learning\nI have a lot of thoughts about this.1\nArtificial intelligence – in particular, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT – are incredibly useful tools. To get the mundane observation out of the way: they are very likely to radically change the way we all work over the next several years, just like a variety of other technologies before them (see: the internet, the personal computer, electricity, the steam engine, the printing press, the wheel, control fire, etc.) AI already has a ton of valuable use cases, including in education, data analysis, and research, and the possibilites are only growing.2\nHowever, to make most effective use of AI, it’s also important to understand exactly what AI is. Current AI models are what is known as Large Langauge Models, or LLMs. An LLM, at its core, is a probabilistic model whose primary function is to produce the next token – usually a word – that is most likely to make sense, based upon some prompt. It does not care if this token represents truth, reality, or a functional line of code – it only cares if the next token seems to make sense. Frequently, what it produces will incidentally be true, functional code, or an accurate representation of the world. That is what makes it useful! Frequently, it will also produce nonsense (or what we formally know as a “hallucination”). LLMs have advised people to eat rocks, hold cheese on pizza with glue, failed to perform simple arithmetic with decimals, and made up wholly invented bibliographic references, statistical libraries, and analysis results.\nFurthermore, this incidental relationship to the real world is by design – it is inherent to the way LLMs work. They don’t verify what they say with base reality, they just spit out what sounds good to probabilistic algorithms.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA Very Academic Note\n\n\n\nLLMs are, in a formal sense, bullshit of the first order. And yes: “bullshit” here is a technical academic term, meaning “language produced without regard for truth.”4\n“The problem here isn’t that large language models hallucinate, lie, or misrepresent the world in some way. It’s that they are not designed to represent the world at all; instead, they are designed to convey convincing lines of text.” (Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, 2024)\nAnd yes, for those interested, the fact that this is from an academic research paper is what makes your normally proper and profanity-averse professor feel somewhat gleefully authorized to use the term “bullshit” in a syllabus.5 There is a more diplomatic and professional seeming word that some use for the profusion of misguided output of AI: slop, which most use to mean the profusion and explosion of low-quality AI material. In short, they mean a profusion of what Frankfurt so artfully frames as bullshit. But with such a pithy and expressive alternative available to us in the English language, why rely on “slop”?\n\n\nThis incidental relationship LLMs have with truth is also what makes relying on an LLM dangerous. You can’t reliably evaluate LLM outputs until you already know enough about a subject to judge good use of language from bad use of language. However, in the very beginning phases of learning how to write code, conduct data analysis, and discuss it, the problem is that you don’t yet know enough about the subject to reliably evaluate the quality of AI outputs.\nFurthermore, and even more problematically, using them early can hamper your ability to understand the fundamental conceptual elements of programming and statistics, concepts which, when will understood, will eventually enable your most effecive use of this new class of tools. Accordingly, I strongly encourage you to avoid using generative-AI tools in this course, except if (and where) encouraged by me. Even if it gives you an immediate shortcut, it is likely put you at a long-term disadvantage, even using AI, when compared to students that learned the old school way.6"

There are also a broader set of other AI-related things happening at Syracuse, including events through the Autonomous Systems Policy Institute (ASPI), resources organized by ITS, and many more.\nA few other things I’d recommend:\n\nMelanie Mitchell, professor at the Santa Fe Institute and one of the most nuanced thinkers about AI I know, has a series of articles that are well worth reading as well as an excellent podcast she hosted on AI. She also was interviewed in one of my favorite blog post titles ever, “How Your Cheese-Powered Baby Trounces AI”.\nAndrew Heiss, a professor in public management and policy at Georgia State’s Andrew Young School, has a similar digression on AI and education that’s worth looking through, including the sources and footnotes. (You’ll note some resemblance between his and my takes.)\nGary Marcus’ substack is generally very AI-critical, but a good place to keep up on current AI trends and hype. Luiza Jarovsky’s substack is a good place to read about AI governance.\nIf you’re more interested in the business and tech industry sides of AI, Benjamin Evans and Ben Thompson are worth adding to your bookmarks-slash-RSS reader-slash-email inbox-slash-future mechanism for keeping track of internet news that hasn’t yet been invented.\n\nFinally, as I’m always eager to know how far students actually read syllabi: if you at this point, and still reading about AI and my thoughts on it, send me an email with a recommendation for your favorite artificial intelligence related novel, movie, or TV-show. I’ll give you a bonus point on your next test for your perserverance and diligence."

If you’re paying attention to some of the details with AI, you know about something called an LRM - or Large Reasoning Model. To a first approximation, they try to introduce better and more complex reasoning into the base prediction process, sometimes going so far to do things like generate python code to do math analysis. These “reasoning” models, however, still often fall short on relatively simple reasoning tasks (see The Illusion of Thinking (2025), published by researchers at Apple).↩︎\nFrankfurt, (2005) On Bullshit; Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, (2024) ChatGPT is Bullshit.

If you want to cut corners and use AI irresponsibly, there’s nothing I can do to stop you. (It’s really just future you that you’re hurting, anyways.) If you want to use LLMs responsibly successfully, well: great!

    "section": "AI and Learning",
    "text": "AI and Learning\nArtificial intelligence – in particular, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT – are incredibly useful tools. To get the mundane observation out of the way: they are likely to radically change the way we all work over the next several years, just like a variety of other technologies before them (see: the internet, the smartphone, the personal computer, electricity, the steam engine, the printing press, etc.) AI already has a ton of valuable use cases, including in education, data analysis, and research, and the possibilities are only growing.1 There are also lots of concerns about AI’s destructive potential, especially for higher education.2\nI do not think AI is the end of higher education. However, I do think that, for you as a student to make most effective use of AI, it’s also important to understand exactly what AI is and how to use it in a way that is both (1) effective and (2) does not hamstring your learning. Current AI models are what is known as Large Language Models, or LLMs. An LLM, at its core, is a probabilistic model whose primary function is to produce the next token – which you can think of as a word – that is most likely to make sense in a sentence or phrase, based upon the input prompt and some surrounding context. It is not an “intelligence” like a human is, and it does not care if this token represents truth, reality, or a functional line of code – it only cares if the next token seems to make sense. Frequently, what it produces will be incidentally true and/or functional. That is what makes it useful! Occasionally, it will also produce nonsense (or what we know as a “hallucination”). LLMs have advised people to eat rocks, hold cheese on pizza with glue, failed to perform simple arithmetic with decimals, and made up wholly invented bibliographic references, statistical libraries, and analysis results.\nFurthermore, this incidental relationship to the real world is by design – it is inherent to the way LLMs work. They don’t verify what they say with base reality, they just spit out what sounds good to probabilistic algorithms.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA Humorous Academic Note\n\n\n\nLLMs are, in a philosophical sense, bullshit of the first order. And yes: “bullshit” here is a technical academic term, meaning “language produced without regard for truth.”4\n“The problem here isn’t that large language models hallucinate, lie, or misrepresent the world in some way. It’s that they are not designed to represent the world at all; instead, they are designed to convey convincing lines of text.” (Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, 2024)\nAnd yes, for those interested, the fact that this is from an academic research paper is what makes your normally proper and somewhat profanity-averse professor feel gleefully authorized to use the term “bullshit” in a course syllabus.5 There is a more diplomatic and professional seeming word that some use for the profusion of misguided output of AI: slop, which most use to mean the profusion and explosion of low-quality AI material. In short, they mean a profusion of what philosophy so artfully frames as bullshit. But with such a pithy and expressive alternative available to us in the English language, why limit ourselves to using the banal sounding “slop”?\n\n\nThis incidental relationship LLMs have with truth is also what makes relying on an LLM dangerous. You can’t reliably evaluate LLM outputs until you already know enough about a subject to judge good use of language from bad use of language. However, in the very beginning phases of learning how to write code, conduct data analysis, and interpret it, the problem is often that you don’t yet know enough about the subject to reliably evaluate the quality of AI outputs.\nFurthermore, using LLMs early on in your learning can hamper your ability to understand the fundamental conceptual elements of programming and statistics.6 Many of your assignments for this class, for instance, are intentionally created to give you practice on beginning concepts - concepts that ChatGPT can answer in a trivially easy fashion. Practice is what gives you familiarity and comfort and working knowledge, but practice doesn’t happen if you just copy language or code that an AI gives you.\nEven more problematically, it is these beginning concepts which, when will understood, will eventually enable your most effective use of this new class of tools for statistical and data work! Accordingly, if you elect to use generative AI to help you with assignments, I strongly encourage you to use them intelligently, rather than carelessly. Use them to help you learn, not to replace your learning; think of them like an interlocutor or teaching assistant, not like an answer bot. Even if plugging an assignment prompt directly into ChatGPT gives you an immediate shortcut, it is likely to put you at a long-term disadvantage, even when using AI, when compared to students that learned the old school way.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantResponsible AI\n\n\n\nRemember: whenever you use AI tools for a project you attach your name to, you are still taking implicit responsibility for that project, product, or document. This means that it is incumbent upon you to do the follow-up work necessary to validate, verify, and confirm that the language and work produced by the machine that works without regard for truth actually is accurate and functional. AI is not a coauthor,8 and I promise you that OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, etc won’t take responsibility for whatever you produce with their tools - that’s on you.9\nJust like any other tool or source you use, all use of AI, in anything you turn in for this class, should be documented and identified in your work. If you used AI to help you write code, note you used AI to help you write code. If you use it to help you write analysis, note how you used it to help you write analysis."

    "text": "Suggestions and Guidelines: AI usage in our course\nFor the reasons above, I would strongly encourage you to be skeptical and not overuse AI as you learn. My job, goal, and interest in this class is to help you, my human student, learn how to do valuable things like write code; wrangle and visualize data; critically interpret information; and learn how to be a more effective citizen and human engaging in the study of data analysis, management, and policy. My interest is not in correcting AI slop,10 nor does my interest lie in trying to figure out if you are attempting to pass unadulterated AI slop11 off as your own work.12 After all, you are allowed to use AI on assignments, if you wish, and I encourage you to do so in productive and valuable ways to enhance your learning, rather than as a way to cheat. Your education, as always, is only as valuable as what you put into it.\nWith all of that said, poor uses of AI are often easily detectable to the eye of me, your professor, and get bad grades regardless.13 Some examples:\n\nStudents who turn in papers and problem sets that reference methodological tools or techniques way beyond the understanding of the material they show in person or on in-class tests and assignments. (I’ve seen many students propose using methods that would only come to them in their third or fourth semester of statistics in an introductory research methods class, for instance.)\nStudents who successfully complete coding assignments, but do so in ways that are overly verbose and complicated relative to simpler and more straightforward methods and techniques covered in class.\nStudents who authoritatively reference scholars who don’t exist, or authoritatively reference scholars that exist but articles or books that those scholars never wrote.\nStudents who turn in assignments that match the style of documents that are well represented in the training set of an LLM (like a five paragraph essay, for instance) but do so for an assignment where the directions were clearly for something else (like, say, a Socratic dialogue.)\n\nIf you do such things in your work, you will find that I take points off not necessarily because you used AI, but because you’ve made a poor use of AI, and the work doesn’t meet the standards of the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI would also encourage you to not make the mistake of confusing assessement with learning.14 Assessment is an obligation of your professor to measure how well you know class material, but assessment is not the end goal of education any more than taking your blood pressure is the end goal of going to a physician’s office. The goal of an education is for you to learn and enhance your critical thinking in ways that will enrich your personal and professional lives. Don’t mistake the means for the end: I don’t care about assessing what ChatGPT “thinks” about something any more than your physician cares about measuring what ChatGPT’s blood pressure is, and I would suggest that you probably don’t care much about that, either.\nUse AI like a tool, keep your thinking your own, and remember: your education is about your own enrichment, not about passing some tests and assignments."

    "text": "The following reflects the approved campus-wide academic policies of Syracuse University. For more information and detail, please consult the full documentation of University policies here.\n\n\nAs part of our efforts to track satisfactory academic progress, the Academic Drop Deadline and the Financial Drop Deadline will both occur on September 15, 2025, for the fall semester and February 2, 2026, for the spring semester. Students may still withdraw from courses after these deadlines; this would place a ‘WD’ grade on their transcripts. Students enrolled in “flex” classes (Flexibly formatted classes) have different deadlines and will need to check MySlice for the Academic and Financial Drop deadlines that pertain to their class.\n\n\n\nAs a pre-eminent and inclusive student-focused research institution, Syracuse University considers academic integrity at the forefront of learning, serving as a core value and guiding pillar of education. Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy provides students with the necessary guidelines to complete academic work with integrity throughout their studies. Students are required to uphold both course-specific and university-wide academic integrity expectations such as crediting your sources, doing your own work, communicating honestly, and supporting academic integrity. The full Syracuse University Academic Integrity Policy can be viewed by visiting the Syracuse University Policies website.\nUpholding Academic Integrity includes the protection of faculty’s intellectual property. Students should not upload, distribute, or share instructors’ course materials, including presentations, assignments, exams, or other evaluative materials without permission. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others, which are then presented as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation. All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person assignments, quizzes, and exams also apply online.\nStudents found in violation of the policy are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. Students may not drop or withdraw from courses in which they face a suspected violation. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\n\n\n\nBased on the specific learning outcomes and assignments in this course, artificial intelligence is permitted on the following: selected course assignments. Artificial intelligence is not permitted on in-class exams. See each assignment, quiz, or exam instructions for more information about what artificial intelligence tools are permitted and to what extent, as well as citation requirements. If no instructions are provided for a specific assignment, then no use of any artificial intelligence tool is permitted. Any AI use beyond that which is detailed in course assignments is explicitly prohibited except when documented permission is granted.\nPlease also see Syracuse University’s general campus AI policies here.\nI, as the instructor, may use generative AI tools to help develop course materials. When I do, I take full responsibility for reviewing and verifying all AI-generated content to ensure it is accurate, appropriate and aligned with our learning objectives. All final course materials represent my professional judgment about what will best support your learning.\n\n\n\nAll academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.\nUsing websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation, resulting in suspension or expulsion from Syracuse University.\n\n\n\nAttendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. It is a federal requirement that faculty promptly notify the university of students who do not attend or cease to attend any class. Faculty will use Early-Semester Progress Reports and Mid-Semester Progress Reports in Orange SUccess to alert the Registrar and Financial Aid Office on non-attendance. For more information visit:\nFaculty: Information for Faculty: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending Students: Information for Students: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending\nIf a student is unable to participate in-person or virtually for an extended period of time (48 hours or more), the student may request an absence notification from their home school/college Dean’s Office or through Student Outreach and Support office. Instructors will be notified via the “Absence Notification” flag in Orange SUccess.\nBarnes Center at the Arch (Health, Counseling, etc.) staff will not provide medical excuse notes for students. When Barnes Center staff determine it is medically necessary to remove a student from classes, they will coordinate with Student Outreach and Support case management staff to provide appropriate notification to faculty through Orange Success. For absences lasting less than 48 hours, students are encouraged to discuss academic arrangements directly with their faculty.\nAdditional information may be found at Student Outreach and Support: Absence Notifications.\n\n\n\nThis class will use the Blackboard Learning Management to house the syllabus, course content, links to external course materials, assignments, quizzes, exams, feedback, and grades. Due dates and times in Blackboard are stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and displayed for each user based on the time zone setting of their computer and data from their internet browser. The system will always display the time zone being used. If an instructor sets a due date of 11pm Eastern time, a student in the Pacific time zone will see a due date of 8pm.”\nInformation about Blackboard is available on Answers Blackboard; alternatively, you can contact Information Technology Services by sending an email to help@syr.edu, calling 315.443.2677, or in-person at the ITS Service Center, located at 1-227 CST in the Life Sciences Complex. Business hours for the Service Center can be found on the ITS website.\n\n\n\nThe University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, reproductive health decisions, disability, marital status, political or social affiliation, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender.\nAny complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer for Faculty and Staff. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under the various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

    "text": "The following reflects the approved campus-wide academic policies of Syracuse University. For more information and detail, please consult the full documentation of University policies here.\n\n\nAs part of our efforts to track satisfactory academic progress, the Academic Drop Deadline and the Financial Drop Deadline will both occur on September 15, 2025, for the fall semester and February 2, 2026, for the spring semester. Students may still withdraw from courses after these deadlines; this would place a ‘WD’ grade on their transcripts. Students enrolled in “flex” classes (Flexibly formatted classes) have different deadlines and will need to check MySlice for the Academic and Financial Drop deadlines that pertain to their class.\n\n\n\nAs a pre-eminent and inclusive student-focused research institution, Syracuse University considers academic integrity at the forefront of learning, serving as a core value and guiding pillar of education. Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy provides students with the necessary guidelines to complete academic work with integrity throughout their studies. Students are required to uphold both course-specific and university-wide academic integrity expectations such as crediting your sources, doing your own work, communicating honestly, and supporting academic integrity. The full Syracuse University Academic Integrity Policy can be viewed by visiting the Syracuse University Policies website.\nUpholding Academic Integrity includes the protection of faculty’s intellectual property. Students should not upload, distribute, or share instructors’ course materials, including presentations, assignments, exams, or other evaluative materials without permission. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others, which are then presented as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation. All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person assignments, quizzes, and exams also apply online.\nStudents found in violation of the policy are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. Students may not drop or withdraw from courses in which they face a suspected violation. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\n\n\n\nBased on the specific learning outcomes and assignments in this course, artificial intelligence is permitted on the following: selected course assignments. Artificial intelligence is not permitted on in-class exams. See each assignment, quiz, or exam instructions for more information about what artificial intelligence tools are permitted and to what extent, as well as citation requirements. If no instructions are provided for a specific assignment, then no use of any artificial intelligence tool is permitted. Any AI use beyond that which is detailed in course assignments is explicitly prohibited except when documented permission is granted.\nPlease also see Syracuse University’s general campus AI policies here.\nI, as the instructor, may use generative AI tools to help develop course materials. When I do, I take full responsibility for reviewing and verifying all AI-generated content to ensure it is accurate, appropriate and aligned with our learning objectives. All final course materials represent my professional judgment about what will best support your learning.\n\n\n\nAll academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.\nUsing websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation, resulting in suspension or expulsion from Syracuse University.\n\n\n\nAttendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. It is a federal requirement that faculty promptly notify the university of students who do not attend or cease to attend any class. Faculty will use Early-Semester Progress Reports and Mid-Semester Progress Reports in Orange SUccess to alert the Registrar and Financial Aid Office on non-attendance. For more information visit:\nFaculty: Information for Faculty: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending Students: Information for Students: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending\nIf a student is unable to participate in-person or virtually for an extended period of time (48 hours or more), the student may request an absence notification from their home school/college Dean’s Office or through Student Outreach and Support office. Instructors will be notified via the “Absence Notification” flag in Orange SUccess.\nBarnes Center at the Arch (Health, Counseling, etc.) staff will not provide medical excuse notes for students. When Barnes Center staff determine it is medically necessary to remove a student from classes, they will coordinate with Student Outreach and Support case management staff to provide appropriate notification to faculty through Orange Success. For absences lasting less than 48 hours, students are encouraged to discuss academic arrangements directly with their faculty.\nAdditional information may be found at Student Outreach and Support: Absence Notifications.\n\n\n\nThis class will use the Blackboard Learning Management to house the syllabus, course content, links to external course materials, assignments, quizzes, exams, feedback, and grades. Due dates and times in Blackboard are stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and displayed for each user based on the time zone setting of their computer and data from their internet browser. The system will always display the time zone being used. If an instructor sets a due date of 11pm Eastern time, a student in the Pacific time zone will see a due date of 8pm.”\nInformation about Blackboard is available on Answers Blackboard; alternatively, you can contact Information Technology Services by sending an email to help@syr.edu, calling 315.443.2677, or in-person at the ITS Service Center, located at 1-227 CST in the Life Sciences Complex. Business hours for the Service Center can be found on the ITS website.\n\n\n\nThe University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, reproductive health decisions, disability, marital status, political or social affiliation, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender.\nAny complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer for Faculty and Staff. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under the various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

I have a high opinion of your intellectual capability and a similarly high opinion of the quality of your potential contributions - make sure to show them to me!\n\n\nDiscussion Questions\nSubmit discussion questions or points (broadly construed) to the class by 9 AM on the day of class. Make sure to send messages to the course Teams chat so everyone can read them.\n\n\nAI News Submissions\nIn class, we’ll occasionally use time in class to discuss AI news from the week. (Especially if something particularly interesting happens . . . which, because this is AI, happens a lot). If you come across interesting AI news - or broad tech industry news - submit it to our Teams chat.\n\n\nDiscussion Leadership\nEach class has an assigned discussion leader from among the students. While all students are under an obligation to read (or listen, or watch) the material each day from class, the discussion leader has a special role as the person who starts our discussion for the day rolling, and steps in should our discussion of the day’s material falter.\n\n\nParticipation Grading Policy\nA seminar like this doesn’t work if everyone only seeks to do the bare minimum. Informed class participation is expected and required each day in class; you shouldn’t be counting things like “I submitted a number of news articles already this semester, so I no longer need to submit news articles or talk in class”. Participate across all elements of the seminar as and when the spirit moves you, and keep that participation up through the semester, and you’ll do fine for this portion of the class.2\nWith that said, it is useful to have some baselines and expectations for everyone to keep in mind. A few that are useful:\n\nAttendance: One of the guiding principles of my class is that you are adults, and thus, capable of managing your own obligations and time. I have little interest in policing your lives, and I understand that everyone has bad days, things that come up, etc.3 You can miss up to three days of class without excuse or penalty, unless that day is a day you have a special obligation. If you are supposed to be a discussion leader, or giving a presentation, taking part in a debate, or miss more than three days, make sure to send me a note.\n\nDiscussion Questions: At least one each day. (Although do note: you should sometimes submit more than one, too!)\nIn-Class Participation: We should hear your contributions every day. We’ll have systems in class to make sure that everyone gets a turn. I won’t be keeping exact tallies of who said what, or how much, but I will take note of your general contribution tendencies.\n\nNews Submissions: At least two news submissions per semester (hopefully more)!\nDiscussion Leadership: Split evenly according to the number of students in the class.\n\n\n\n\nPrepared Class Work\n\nDebates\nWe will have six formal debates in the class, following a modified Lincoln-Douglas debate format (if you are unfamiliar with these rules, don’t worry! We’ll cover them.) Each student will have a role in each debate, although not all roles are equal: it is easier to judge than it is to affirm or negate. All students will have equal debate responsibilities across the class.\n\n\nShort Assignments\nSmall assignments about AI tools will be given throughout the semester. They may involve presentations to the class.\n\n\n\nCore Exam\nAn in class test on AI basics, held in the middle of the semester.\n\n\nFinal Project\nA final research project on an aspect of AI policy. (There will be options.) Graduate students will have higher expectations than undergraduates."

    "text": "🎓 Course Expectations & Guidelines\n\nEtiquette & Decorum\nThis is an upper level undergraduate and graduate course: I take it for granted that you have a basic interest in the material and an enthusiastic attitude toward participation. A university classroom is fundamentally a learning community that operates on respect: be courteous to fellow students and the professor, attend class on time, listen to fellow seminar participants when they talk, and disagree (or agree) with others’ arguments professionally. Keep cell phones and other technology silenced and out of sight unless doing something directly relevant to the discussion in the class.4\n\n\nOffice & Consultation Hours, Appointments\nI encourage you to chat with me at any point if you have questions about the course. You are always welcome to drop by my office hours, and can schedule a meeting with me by going to my website here: http://jacklreilly.github.io. You do not need an appointment for regularly scheduled drop-in office hours: they are there for you! Furthermore, I have a general open-door policy: feel free to stop by to see if my door is open, and if it is, just come on in. (Don’t feel like you’re intruding! I’ll tell you if it’s not a good time.)\n\n\nE-mail\nEmail is the best way to contact me. I try to be pretty responsive, but as a baseline, I always aim to get back to you in a modified 24-hour fashion: by the end of the business day the day after you email (at minimum). So if you email me at 2 PM Tuesday, I’ll get back to you by 6 PM Wednesday at the latest; if 10 PM Thursday, by 6 PM Friday; if you email me at 3 PM on Friday, by 6 PM Monday, etc.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your email requires a long response, expect me to encourage you to meet with me in person so we can have a more effective discussion.\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Class Technology Policy\nTo be discussed (and decided upon!) in class on a per-assignment basis."

    "section": "🏫 Campus Academic Resources & Policies",
    "text": "🏫 Campus Academic Resources & Policies\nThe following reflects the approved campus-wide academic policies of Syracuse University. For more information and detail, please consult the full documentation of University policies here.\n\n⚠️ Academic Drop Deadline\nAs part of our efforts to track satisfactory academic progress, the Academic Drop Deadline and the Financial Drop Deadline will both occur on September 15, 2025, for the fall semester and February 2, 2026, for the spring semester. Students may still withdraw from courses after these deadlines; this would place a ‘WD’ grade on their transcripts. Students enrolled in “flex” classes (Flexibly formatted classes) have different deadlines and will need to check MySlice for the Academic and Financial Drop deadlines that pertain to their class.\n\n\n📖 Academic Integrity\nAs a pre-eminent and inclusive student-focused research institution, Syracuse University considers academic integrity at the forefront of learning, serving as a core value and guiding pillar of education. Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy provides students with the necessary guidelines to complete academic work with integrity throughout their studies. Students are required to uphold both course-specific and university-wide academic integrity expectations such as crediting your sources, doing your own work, communicating honestly, and supporting academic integrity. The full Syracuse University Academic Integrity Policy can be viewed by visiting the Syracuse University Policies website.\nUpholding Academic Integrity includes the protection of faculty’s intellectual property. Students should not upload, distribute, or share instructors’ course materials, including presentations, assignments, exams, or other evaluative materials without permission. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others, which are then presented as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation. All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person assignments, quizzes, and exams also apply online.\nStudents found in violation of the policy are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. Students may not drop or withdraw from courses in which they face a suspected violation. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\n\n\n🤖 Artificial Intelligence\nBased on the specific learning outcomes and assignments in this course, artificial intelligence is permitted on the following: selected course assignments. Artificial intelligence is not permitted on in-class exams. See each assignment, quiz, or exam instructions for more information about what artificial intelligence tools are permitted and to what extent, as well as citation requirements. If no instructions are provided for a specific assignment, then no use of any artificial intelligence tool is permitted. Any AI use beyond that which is detailed in course assignments is explicitly prohibited except when documented permission is granted.\nPlease also see Syracuse University’s general campus AI policies here.\nI, as the instructor, may use generative AI tools to help develop course materials. When I do, I take full responsibility for reviewing and verifying all AI-generated content to ensure it is accurate, appropriate and aligned with our learning objectives. All final course materials represent my professional judgment about what will best support your learning.\n\n\n💻 Academic Integrity Online\nAll academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.\nUsing websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation, resulting in suspension or expulsion from Syracuse University.\n\n\n👤 Attendance Policy\nAttendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. It is a federal requirement that faculty promptly notify the university of students who do not attend or cease to attend any class. Faculty will use Early-Semester Progress Reports and Mid-Semester Progress Reports in Orange SUccess to alert the Registrar and Financial Aid Office on non-attendance. For more information visit:\nFaculty: Information for Faculty: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending Students: Information for Students: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending\nIf a student is unable to participate in-person or virtually for an extended period of time (48 hours or more), the student may request an absence notification from their home school/college Dean’s Office or through Student Outreach and Support office. Instructors will be notified via the “Absence Notification” flag in Orange SUccess.\nBarnes Center at the Arch (Health, Counseling, etc.) staff will not provide medical excuse notes for students. When Barnes Center staff determine it is medically necessary to remove a student from classes, they will coordinate with Student Outreach and Support case management staff to provide appropriate notification to faculty through Orange Success. For absences lasting less than 48 hours, students are encouraged to discuss academic arrangements directly with their faculty.\nAdditional information may be found at Student Outreach and Support: Absence Notifications.\n\n\n🖼 Blackboard\nThis class will use the Blackboard Learning Management to house the syllabus, course content, links to external course materials, assignments, quizzes, exams, feedback, and grades. Due dates and times in Blackboard are stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and displayed for each user based on the time zone setting of their computer and data from their internet browser. The system will always display the time zone being used. If an instructor sets a due date of 11pm Eastern time, a student in the Pacific time zone will see a due date of 8pm.”\nInformation about Blackboard is available on Answers Blackboard; alternatively, you can contact Information Technology Services by sending an email to help@syr.edu, calling 315.443.2677, or in-person at the ITS Service Center, located at 1-227 CST in the Life Sciences Complex. Business hours for the Service Center can be found on the ITS website.\n\n\n🚫 Discrimination and Harassment\nThe University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, reproductive health decisions, disability, marital status, political or social affiliation, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender.\nAny complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer for Faculty and Staff. She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under the various laws including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 621 Skytop Road, Suite 1001, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244-1120; or by email: equalopp@syr.edu; or by telephone: 315-443-4018.\n\n\n🌍 Diversity\nIt is the intent of this course for students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives to be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is also critical to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let your instructor know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.\n\n\n🤝 Disability\nSyracuse University values access and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be necessary to ensure equitable access, and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process.\nIf you would like to discuss disability-related accommodations or register with CDR, please visit Center for Disability Resources. Please call 315.443.4498 or email CDRspecialist@syr.edu for more detailed information.\nCDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations are generally not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible to initiate this process.\n\n\n🌐 Faith and Religious Accommodations\nSyracuse University’s Religious Observances Policy recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holy days according to their traditions. Under the policy, students are given an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance, provided they notify their instructors no later than the academic drop deadline. For observances occurring before the drop deadline, notification is required at least two academic days in advance. Students may enter their observances in MySlice under Student Services/Enrollment/My Religious Observances/Add a Notification.\n\n\n📝 FERPA\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) sets forth requirements regarding the privacy of student records. FERPA governs both the access to and release of those records, known as education records, and the information they contain. Under FERPA, faculty have a legal responsibility to protect the confidentiality of student records. For additional information about FERPA and Syracuse University’s FERPA policy, see Compliance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act or contact the Office of the Registrar (315.443.2422).\n\n\n🩺 Health and Wellness\nWell-being and mental health are significant predictors of academic success. It is critical to take care of yourself physically and emotionally and to effectively navigate stress, anxiety, and depression. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the Barnes Center provides https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/ and seek out support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are available 24/7, 365 days, at 315-443-8000.\n\n\n🍊 ORANGE Alert\nORANGE ALERT, Syracuse University’s crisis notification system, uses text messages, phone, and email alerts to provide rapid notification and instructions to members of the University community in the event of a crisis in progress. In the event of an emergency, please use one of the following numbers to reach us:\nFrom any phone: 315.443.2224 From your cell phone: #78 (#SU) Campus landline: 711\nFor more information on ORANGE ALERT, including how to update your contact information, visit the DPS website."

In particular, I stay around after class for up to half an hour if students come by - feel free to stay after and meet with me.↩︎\nFor the grade for this section, I hope and expect to be able to simply award full points to everyone based on apparent enthusiasm and contributions across the whole semester.↩︎\nI also understand that some of these things that come up may be things you don’t want to discuss with your professor. That’s OK! The attendance policy is designed so that you typically don’t have to tell me you missed because you have a medical emergency or a family matter you’d rather not discuss.↩︎\nRemember that technology presents a significant negative externality: it is not just you that is distracted, but it is you who are distracting others as well with the bright shiny colors on your screen.↩︎\nUsually I aim to be much much faster!
