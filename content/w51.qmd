### Tip
 - "📖 Read", "🎧 Listen", and/or "📺 Watch" items are required content for the day, and should be read/heard/watched before class on that day.
 - "🌐 Browse" items should be briefly looked at but do not need to be read deeply unless you want to
 - "📚 Additional Resources" do not need to be looked at; they are there to serve, if useful, as further references for your debates, final projects, and general edification later.
