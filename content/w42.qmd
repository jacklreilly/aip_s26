title: "4.2 - Data Privacy and Algorithmic Bias"
---

#### 🧠 Think: 
- *How does the reliance on data in AI structure the way we think of AI's potential and power? When we think of the assorted challenges, from the technical to the social to the legal and back again, including training set issues, algorithmic bias, long tail problems, copyright issues, how do the makers of AI respond? How should the AI industry respond?*
