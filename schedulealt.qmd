All readings may be found linked from the course content pages.  Readings will be posted at least one week ahead of time. Each day will have one or two primary readings that should be read closely, a series of simpler secondary readings (often, news coverage, podcasts, and/or videos) that should be browsed or scanned, and (frequently) further secondary reading for those interested in diving deeper. 

**Undergraduate students** are expected to read or listen to the primary source(s) for the day and scan background readings. 

**Graduate students** are expected to read or listen to the primary source(s), scan background readings, and select one or more of the background readings to read in further depth, as well.
